    let title = "Role of the Scout Platoon"
    let titleContent = "The scout platoon’s mission is to conduct reconnaissance and security operations to answer the commander’s information requirements and provide early warning to the protected force. Specifically, it conducts tasks to satisfy the commander’s critical information requirements (CCIRs) before the latest time the information is of value (LTIOV) expires. Commanders specifically assign the scout platoon missions for any given operation based on known and projected friendly operations, the range of threats, and their understanding of potential areas of operations (AO). Scouts then confirm or deny commanders’ assumptions.\nScout platoons conduct reconnaissance and security missions in close contact with enemy organizations and civilian populations to allow maneuver commanders to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative and obtain a position of relative advantage."
